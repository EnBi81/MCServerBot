# MCServerBot
## Short Description
This project was created to make my friends able to start and stop a minecraft server which I hosted on my own computer. It started as a simple Discord bot, but eventually it became a much larger project than I thought. Currently, it hosts both a Discord bot, and a small ASP.Net core webserver, which my friends can visit through Hamachi, and manage the minecraft server.

This project is WIP.

## Latest info:
Now the program is able to have not one, but many minecraft servers, this is only implemented in the Discord Bot, the webserver is still under development.
